# TinyApp Project

Do you ever have the sudden urge to "Rick Roll" someone? No? Just me? oh...

The best time to "Rick Roll" a friend is when they least expect it... aka now, since the trend has died. 

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Oh yeah, you can also use it to shorten links for your captions/tweets.
